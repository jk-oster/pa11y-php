## Usage

### Generating your first report

With the package installed, this is how you can run **pa11y**:

```php
// TODO
```

You can use the count methods to get the number of accessibility errors / warning / notices on your page.

```php
// TODO
```

To get an array of all errors call ``errors()``:

```php
// TODO
```

### Configuring a run

There are various methods to configure how Pa11y should run.

#### Only report errors without warnings or notices

#### Configure different accessibility validator

### Generate report from sitemap
